2.4.1 Semi-Anticlog Cluster/Baseline Mode!
Groups of storages can finally be accounted as a sum via Cluster Mode
Old Behavior is Basline Mode, just set IsCluster to 0/false

#also some general bugfixes and blinking is optimized, need to work on QOL

Desc: Anti Clog for any General Storage-unloader-Storage Transport

Set its Config
Bind the Destination Storage
(ex: container, vault)
Bind the unloader 
(or other config blocks if needed)
Create the transport from unloader to destination

And you have your transport!

Features/Variables:
Up to 4 receiving storageblocks, automatic storage and config block detection, and fast performance in a logic processor
MaxPercent - what is the target quota of items in storageblock/s, and provides a buffer as if it is too high, a clog will happen
OriginBlock - setting up what storageblock has the items, automatically detects Core when set to null
MinOriginAmount - Allows rss (resource saver) by not requesting the items from OriginBlock, essentially dont cause resource-gon
IsCluster - either treats the storageblocks as a sum, or tries to fill each storageblock with a mininum amount of items
MemoryReadLocation/MemoryWriteLocation - allows for custom config override, and chaining other Semi-AntiClog

Notes:
This is not specialized on one specific schematic, it more used on a variety of schems. Its something you may modify on use on the fly
