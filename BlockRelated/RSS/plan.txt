Intitalization Of Variables

Message Block: What messageBlock to output
PowerThreshold: If power goes below this, disable all binded blocks (set to -1, if no PowerRSS)
Default State Input and Outut: -1 gets replaced
Lists of Items with a limit to activate: Example
    set (copperPicture)Limit 0: Do not Consider in Calc
    set (leadPicture)Limit -1: Default State
    set (graphitePicture)Limit 2022: if Coreitems is below this disable nullloader or (selectedItem)loader, and null all sorters binded
DisableTransportBlocks: If a transport block contains output item: Disable
DisableIf Full: Disables Everything if one of the outputs is full
Items Being Outputed
    set (phasefabricPicture) 400: if Coreitems is above this value disable all binded blocks with this item
    set (surgeAlloyPicture) -400: negative here means Core - 400 beforechecking like normal
Binded or UnitDetection For Core (OriginBlock): if a building, use that as "Core"
FindCore if Origin is null, find core via unit
Generate Starter Bits: replace -1 values with Default State, then create a bit set based on Limits
    These will be two, one for input and output

Calculation

Storage Core + Dead Check
Storage PowerBlock + Dead Check
set UsedBits StarterBits (I and O)
PowerCheck: if below threshold => disable everything and jump to Action
Generate Bits: Do Input Set Checks first, modifying Used Bits, then output based on it

Action
If powergon: just disable everything then end
Looping through everyblock
    if unloader: check config via reverse lookup (manual grr) and disable/enable
    if sorter/inv: check via input, then just set to null
    anything else: check all of its items, then do outputUsedBits check (reverse lookup again Aahdhifgf)

MessageCode1: What Values To Show (0 if error)
    0: Nothing
    1: Normal Operation: Swicthes Between 2 and 3
    2: Input Variables: Force
    3: Output Variables: Force

MessageCode2: Current Status
    0: All Operational, Have a lovely day
    1: PowerGon: Ohno
    2: Item Input Is too low: Show Item that is bellow with Item < Var
    3: Outputing Item Too High: Disabling all Binded Blocks with it
    4: Both Input and Output is UnHappy: Cant Display all so just say stuff is getting disabled

#This... Is gonna be a ton of if checks

Overall Plan:
Support Normal RSS Features
Support MultiItem Output:
Hardcode, Unrolled Loops 2: Make It fast as possible
