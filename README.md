# Mindustry---Mlog
List of some of the logic(mlog) I use in Mindustry

# Notes:

AntiClog Logic: Mlog used to prevent clogging when moving items from one storage block to another.

UnitBind: One of the logic bases of all of my unit logic schems

General Overange: The unit makesmart thing idk, origins is from a youtube video/tutorial as a basis in similar structure but I've built it more to have more behavior.
